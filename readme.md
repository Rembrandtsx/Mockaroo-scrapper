Apply your credentials, add the number of times you want the script to be executed*, and the schemas you want to be executed on:
`config.js`

*For each time you put on the config file you'll get a 1000 rows per table schema, so if you have 10 schemas and you put 10 as number of times you want the code to be executed, you'll get 100.000 row of data (10.000 per table).
